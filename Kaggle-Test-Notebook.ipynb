    "# Kaggle Competition: Pet Adoption\n",
    "\n",
    "`source`: https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "Millions of stray animals suffer on the streets or are euthanized in shelters every day around the world. If homes can be found for them, many precious lives can be saved — and more happy families created.\n",
    "\n",
    "[PetFinder.my](https://petfinder.my/) has been Malaysia’s leading animal welfare platform since 2008, with a database of more than 150,000 animals. PetFinder collaborates closely with animal lovers, media, corporations, and global organizations to improve animal welfare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Animal adoption rates are strongly correlated to the metadata associated with their online profiles, such as descriptive text and photo characteristics. As one example, PetFinder is currently experimenting with a simple AI tool called the Cuteness Meter, which ranks how cute a pet is based on qualities present in their photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition you will be developing algorithms to predict the adoptability of pets - specifically, how quickly is a pet adopted? If successful, they will be adapted into AI tools that will guide shelters and rescuers around the world on improving their pet profiles' appeal, reducing animal suffering and euthanization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Top participants may be invited to collaborate on implementing their solutions into AI tools for assessing and improving pet adoption performance, which will benefit global animal welfare.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Description\n",
    "In this competition you will predict the speed at which a pet is adopted, based on the pet’s listing on PetFinder. Sometimes a profile represents a group of pets. In this case, the speed of adoption is determined by the speed at which all of the pets are adopted. The data included text, tabular, and image data. See below for details. \n",
    "This is a Kernels-only competition. At the end of the competition, test data will be replaced in their entirety with new data of approximately the same size, and your kernels will be rerun on the new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### File descriptions\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Data Fields\n",

    "* `Description` - Profile write-up for this pet. The primary language used is English, with some in Malay or Chinese.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AdoptionSpeed\n",
    "Contestants are required to predict this value. The value is determined by how quickly, if at all, a pet is adopted. The values are determined in the following way:\n",
    "* $0$ - Pet was adopted on the same day as it was listed. \n",
    "* $1$ - Pet was adopted between 1 and 7 days (1st week) after being listed. \n",
    "* $2$ - Pet was adopted between 8 and 30 days (1st month) after being listed. \n",
    "* $3$ - Pet was adopted between 31 and 90 days (2nd & 3rd month) after being listed. \n",
    "* $4$ - No adoption after 100 days of being listed. (There are no pets in this dataset that waited between 90 and 100 days).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Images\n",
    "For pets that have photos, they will be named in the format of *`PetID-ImageNumber.jpg`*. Image $1$ is the profile (`default`) photo set for the pet. For privacy purposes, faces, phone numbers and emails have been masked.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Image Metadata\n",
    "We have run the images through **`Google's Vision API`**, providing analysis on `Face Annotation`, `Label Annotation`, `Text Annotation` and `Image Properties`. You may optionally utilize this supplementary information for your image analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "File name format is *`PetID-ImageNumber.json`*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some properties will not exist in JSON file if not present, i.e. Face Annotation. Text Annotation has been simplified to just 1 entry of the entire text description (instead of the detailed JSON result broken down by individual characters and words). Phone numbers and emails are already anonymized in Text Annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Vision API reference: https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/reference/rest/v1/images/annotate\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sentiment Data\n",
    "We have run each pet profile's description through **`Google's Natural Language API`**, providing analysis on sentiment and key entities. You may optionally utilize this supplementary information for your pet description analysis. There are some descriptions that the API could not analyze. As such, there are fewer sentiment files than there are rows in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "File name format is *`PetID.json`*.\n",
    "\n",
