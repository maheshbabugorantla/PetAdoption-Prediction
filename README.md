# Kaggle Pet Adoption Prediction

## Description
In this competition you will predict the speed at which a pet is adopted, based on the petâ€™s listing on PetFinder. Sometimes a profile represents a group of pets. In this case, the speed of adoption is determined by the speed at which all of the pets are adopted. The data included text, tabular, and image data. See below for details.<br>

This is a Kernels-only competition. At the end of the competition, test data will be replaced in their entirety with new data of approximately the same size, and your kernels will be rerun on the new data.
